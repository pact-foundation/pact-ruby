# This gemfile is used to test that the pact library works ok when active support is loaded.
# It is in a separate file because active support will not work on ruby 2.4, and the only
# place that should be using ruby 2.4 is the pact-ruby-standalone, which will be guaranteed not
# to have active support on it. I think :D
